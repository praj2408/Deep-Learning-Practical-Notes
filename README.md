# Interview Questions

1. What is deep learning?  
Deep learning is subfield of machine learning inspired by structure and function
of brain called artificial neural network. We have a lot numbers of algorithms
under machine learning like Linear regression, SVM, Neural network etc and
deep learning is just an extention of Neural networks. In neural nets we consider
small number of hidden layers but when it comes to deep learning algorithms we
consider a huge number of hidden latyers to better understand the input output
relationship.
